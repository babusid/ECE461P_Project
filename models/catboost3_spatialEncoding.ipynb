    "Currently, our data contains FIPS codes. Up until now, we haven't used these codes to provide additional context. We may be able to improve model performance by encoding these into spatial coordinates. By adding spatial context in the form of latitude/longitude pairs, it will make the rows from nearby counties more similar to each other. This will allow the model to better capture the spatial context of the data.\n",
