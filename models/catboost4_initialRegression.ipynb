    "After talking to the TA, she noted that the penalty for classifying a D0 as a D5 should be harsher than classifying a D0 as a D1. This could be done using a custom loss function passed to a classifier, but we can also just implement it as a regression problem and let the default loss functions do their job. For this attempt, we will use spatial encoding on the raw dataset, as we know that that greatly assists the classifier model, and it will likely help the regressor as well. "
