# Contribution Guidelines

- This Repo features a branch protection rule that keeps you from committing directly to main. You will have to branch off, create your own branch, commit your work, and then create a pull request to merge your branch into main.
- Please make sure to add a descriptive commit message when you commit your work.
- You will have to create a folder named "data" in the root of this project, and download the three zip files of data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdminix/us-drought-meteorological-data
- After you've downloaded the data, unzip the files and place them in the "data" folder. It should be 3 CSV files.
